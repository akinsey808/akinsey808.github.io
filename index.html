        a very useful skill for living in Hawai'i. This skill helped me to become a well-rounded

        Gardening was a huge part of my love for nature, especially the butterfly garden
        in kindergarten. We had 'Aina Is and garden parties. We ate the outcomes of 
        our own hard work and watched catepillars grow in the crownflower bush. We had to 
        work together to make it work. Gardening helped me to become collaborative.

        Creativity. It isn't a subject or even an activity. It was a way of thinking.
        The way of letting your mind do its job. It was always subtly taught. Our teachers 
        never told us what to do in math projects. Everything was worked with or as a side
        effect of creativity. This helped me to become socially responsible and self-confident.

        This is a letter from your future self. A version of you who has been through a lot more. I am writing
        to give you some advice. 1) Do not stress! Have fun, it's only the first few years of your life. Everything
        will follow through. 2) Make good friends. I know you did, but you don't want to be friendless now, trust me. 3) 
        Don't try to change who you are/ stay weird. Nothing is as important as you being you. You were born as yourself.
        And that is how the world wants you. I hope, if this ever gets to you, you take it seriously. You are so mportant 
        to me. I mean, you are me so...<br><br>
