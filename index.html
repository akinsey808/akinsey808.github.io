                    <div class="back"> At Wai'alae 'ukulele was always known. You would make sure to keep you grades up in music so 'ukulele was easy. Then, we were always excited for the chance to be recognized for being in 'Ukulele Band. When you finally got to start playing in 4th grade we wore the correct shirts and made sure not to forget our binders. This skill helped me to be capable of multiple dimesions. </div>

We had Hour of Code acople of times, all of wich I enjoyed but were unchallenging. Which is probably why I was inspired to do this website. Hour of Code helped me to become a creative problem solver. </div>

                    <div class="back"> Gardening was a huge part of my love for nature, especially the butterfly garden in kindergarten. We had 'Aina Is and garden parties. We ate the outcomes of our own hard work and watched catepillars grow in the crownflower bush. We had to work together to make it work. Gardening helped me to become collaborative. </div>

                    <div class="back"> Creativity. It isn't a subject or even an activity. It was a way of thinking. The way of letting your mind do its job. It was always subtly taught. Our teachers never told us what to do in math projects. Everything was worked with or as a side effect of creativity. This helped me to become socially responsible and self-confident. </div>

A version of you who has been through a lot more. I am writing to give you some advice. 1) Do not stress! Have fun, it's only the first few years of your life. Everything will follow through. 2) Make good friends. I know you did, but you don't want to be friendless now, trust me. 3) Don't try to change who you are/ stay weird. Nothing is as important as you being you. You were born as yourself. And that is how the world wants you. I hope, if this ever gets to you, you take it seriously. You are so mportant to me. I mean, you are me so...<br><br>
